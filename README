randomjsf - Jenkins Small Fast (JSF) RNG for Ruby

http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/smallprng.html
https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/some-prng-implementations.html

this code is based on the above and the JSF implementation in the
Game::Xomb Perl module


INSTALLATION

there are probably better ways to do this

    gem build randomjsf.gemspec
    gem environment   # find a suitable GEM PATH
    gem install -i ... randomjsf


USAGE

there is an "irand" method (and also a coinflip method) that uses
whatever seed is associated with the RNG. this method returns a number
that came from a 32-bit unsigned integer

    ruby -rrandomjsf -e 'x = RandomJsf.new 42; puts x.irand'
